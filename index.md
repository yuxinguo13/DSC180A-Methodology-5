## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter is the Weisfeiler-Lehman Test, especially its applications in GNN. The WL Test is used for graph isomorphism testing, which can efficiently determine whether two graphs are structurally identical. In GNN, the WL test aggregates and updates node features by considering the features of neighboring nodes, effectively capturing the local graph structure. If the WL test told us that two graph is the same, then we cannot run GNN on these two graphs, since no matter what model we applied to the two grpahs, they will always give us the same result.
